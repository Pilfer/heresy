/*
* This script gets loaded before the index.android.bundle file is loaded by the app.
* It can be used to perform any setup or initialization before the app starts.
* Note: Most/all global variables and objects are not accessible at this point. 
* setInterval, setTimeout, and other global functions are not available.
*
* As of right now this script is essentially useless, but I'm hoping someone finds something cool to do here.
